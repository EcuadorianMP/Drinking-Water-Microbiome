## Abstract 

Glaciers are extreme and unique ecosystems where temperature can be below zero and are reservoirs of vast bacterial diversity.
These habitats are mainly threatened by climate change, specifically global warming. 
The havoc of the temperature increment impacts more to glaciers located in the tropics, such as the Andes in Ecuador.
These highly affected environments require immediate effort to assess and study its biodiversity. 
It is of the utmost importance for Andean glaciers to discover the bacterial architecture and diversity before the glacier completes it retreats,
losing this ecosystem forever.Amplicon metagenomics was employed to explore the microcosm community in their biogeographical 
patterns in the ice-capped Cayambe volcanic complex along a chronosequence of 5 years with three sampling efforts.
The dominant phyla in the assessed glacier niches were Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes, 
Firmicutes, and Planctynomictes. We found two main patterns depending on the altitudinal gradient and temporal scale. 
High altitude samples (> 5200 masl) tend to have lower alpha-diversity than low altitude samples 
(< 5200). Meanwhile, at the time scale, the genus richness tends to decrease over the chronosequence. 
We found that higher nitrogen content can be linked to a greater abundance of Firmicutes 
and Nitrobacter in soil samples, while the greater concentration of phosphorus might be linked 
to the P-solubilizer presence Pseudomonas species. Moreover, the reported Stenotrophomonas genus
requires further investigation since cold-activated enzymes with biotechnological applications have been 
isolated from glaciers. Finally, we suggest the metacommunity structure of the entire Cayambe ecosystem and the 
specific metacommunity for the ice-snow-lake niches.The bacterial communities in ice-snow-lake and soil niches are structurally
different and strongly influenced by the altitudinal gradient. Geochemical variables have a strong influence on the beta-diversity
and create a complex interaction network and community assembly.
