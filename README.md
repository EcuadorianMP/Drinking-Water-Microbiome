## Abstract

Bacterial communities in drinking water provide a gauge to measure quality and confer insights into public health. In contrast to urban systems, water treatment in rural areas is not adequately monitored and could become a health risk. We performed 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing to analyze the microbiome present in the water treatment plants (WTP) at two rural agricultural communities, one city, and the downstream water for human consumption in schools and reservoirs in the Andean highlands of Ecuador. We tested the effect of water treatment on the diversity and composition of bacterial communities. A set of physicochemical variables in the sampled water was evaluated and correlated with the structure of the observed bacterial communities. Predominant bacteria in the analyzed communities belonged to Proteobacteria and Actinobacteria. The Sphingobium genus, a chlorine resistance group, was particularly abundant. Of health concern in drinking water reservoirs were Fusobacteriaceae, Lachnospiraceae, and Ruminococcaceae; these families are associated with human and poultry fecal contamination. We propose the latter families as relevant biomarkers for establishing local standards for the monitoring of potable water systems in agricultural lands in highland Ecuador. Our assessment of bacterial community composition in water systems in the Ecuadorian highlands provides a technical background to inform management decisions.

According to the ANOVA test, Mg2+, Na+, K+, and pH are statistically significant predictors (p \< 0.05) of community structure. (B) A tree based on the neighbor joining algorithm for the Lachnospiraceae and Ruminococcaceae families, branch values are bootstrap support. The tree should not be used to interpret phylogenetic relationships (hence, the low branch bootstrap support), but to highlight the diversity of genera within these two health-relevant families in water treatment systems in Ecuador](R/plots/Main/Final%20png/Figure_3.jpeg)
